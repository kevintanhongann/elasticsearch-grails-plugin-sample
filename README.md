# Elasticsearch Grails plugin - Sample App #

A sample app for the Elasticsearch Grails plugin. The plugin homepage is maintained by Noam Y. Tenne and hosted at https://github.com/noamt/elasticsearch-grails-plugin.

## Why? ##

If you're used to grails but have never used [Elasticsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/), chances are you'll be a bit lost after installing the plugin.
Elasticsearch is as powerful as it is complicated to understand for the newcomers.

This sample app aims to make it easier on users to get what the plugin actually enables in terms of mapping, indexing and searching via ES.
