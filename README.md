# Elasticsearch Grails plugin - Sample App #

A sample app for the Elasticsearch Grails plugin. The plugin homepage is maintained by Noam Y. Tenne and hosted at https://github.com/noamt/elasticsearch-grails-plugin.

## Why? ##

If you're used to grails but have never used [Elasticsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/), chances are you'll be a bit lost after installing the plugin.
Elasticsearch is as powerful as it is complicated to understand for the newcomers.

This sample app aims to make it easier on users to get what the plugin actually enables in terms of mapping, indexing and searching via ES.

## How ##

In order to fully understand the relationship between the different cases implemented with this project, it is recommended to use it in the following way:

  * Experiment with the different available client modes by changing the options in `Config.groovy`

### Domains

The domains in this application try to use as extensiveley the mapping options provided by the plugin. To find a specific mapping, please refer to the following list:

####Â Domain class TODO

  - [x] Many-to-One mapping (in `Musician` and `Song` domains).
  - [x] `parent` / `child` mapping (in `Musician` and `Song` domains).
  - [x] `geoPoint` mapping (in `Location` domain).
  - [x] `multi_field` mapping (in `Song` domain's `title` field).
  - [ ] `converter` mapping.
  - [ ] `excludeFromAll` mapping.
  - [ ] `index` mapping.
  - [ ] `analyzer` mapping.


In order to understand the impact of each mapping option, it is strongly recommended that you check the `JSON` results after launching the app using curl. Your command should look like the following:

````
  curl -XGET localhost:9200/org.elasticsearch.plugin.sample/_mapping?pretty
````

### Search

There are many different approaches to searching indexed documents using the plugin, as well as many different `query`, `filter` and `facets` options. The following list shows what is currently implemented and what will be in the future:

#### Search TODO

  - [ ] queries:
    - [x]  `has_child` (see `MusicianService.searchMusicianOrderBySongCount`)
    - [ ] `filtered`
    - [ ] `fuzzy_like_this`
  - [ ] filters:
    - [ ] `geoDistance`
  - [] sorts:
    - [x] `sortBuilder.fieldSort` (see `MusicianService.searchMusicianOrderBySongCountMissingLast`).
    - [x] field sort via `Domain.search([sort: 'foo', order: 'bar'], { ... })`  (see `MusicianService.searchMusicianOrderBySongCount`).
    - [x] multiple fields sorting via multiple `sortBuilders` (see `MusicianService.searchMusicianOrderBySongCountMissingLast`).
 
If you want something implemented, feel free to create an issue on this repository or tweet [@MonsieurCelsius](twitter.com/MonsieurCelsius) and I'll see what I can do..
